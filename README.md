# messi-games-notify
Notifies the user of any Messi games or reports related to him.

** to get up and running with this scraper do: 
    pip install requirements.txt
    and then run messiGamesNotify.py

- add an email or phone notification component
- add a news component

The plan is to make a github actions part and it runs twice a month to notify the user of the games going on it that month.
